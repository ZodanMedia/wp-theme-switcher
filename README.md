# z-theme-switcher
> A WordPress plugin that lets selected user roles switch temporarily and non-persistent to another (than the active) theme.

When we are developing themes, we quite often like to switch between the old (active) and the new (to develop) version of a theme. Sometimes without other people noticing.
This plugin does exactly that.


**Project page**

See https://speelwei.zodan.nl/wp-theme-switcher/


## What does it do?

It lets users with certain roles see another (than the currently active) theme, by 
* Selecting a theme from the list of installed themes,
* Selecting which user roles are permitted to switch themes, and
* Optionally, selecting user roles that can use a 'switch theme/back' button on the front-end.


## What needs to be done?

This plugin is under active development.
Any feature requests are welcome at plugins@zodan.nl.


## WordPress version support

This should work as of WordPress v5.5 up till v6.8
