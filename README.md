# z-theme-switcher
> A WordPress plugin for a mini menu to access most common admin items when the admin bar is not active.

In most of our custom WordPress themes, we like to view our pages without the admin bar. Still, while developing or maintaining a website, we like to have access to some of the most common admin items. This tiny menu helps a bit.


**Project page**

See https://speelwei.zodan.nl/wp-theme-switcher/


## What does it do?

It lets users with certain roles see another (than the currently active) theme, by 
* Selecting a theme from the list of installed themes,
* Selecting which user roles are permitted to switch themes, and
* Optionally, selecting user roles that can use a 'switch theme/back' button on the front-end.


## What needs to be done?

This plugin is under active development.
Any feature requests are welcome at plugins@zodan.nl.


## WordPress version support

This should work as of WordPress v5.5 up till v6.8
